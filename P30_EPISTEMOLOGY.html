<p><strong>EPISTEMOLOGY</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">This web page attempts to succinctly encapsulate and to communicate the website author&#8217;s current understanding of what fundamentally constitutes <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality</a>.</span></p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>ontology</strong> refers to the branch of philosophy which pertains exclusively to analyzing worldview models. Meanwhile, the term <strong>epistemology</strong> refers to the processes involved in constructing worldview models such as <strong>science</strong> (i.e. gathering empirical data which is used to make worldview models more accurate and more comprehensive as the total amount of accumulated empirical data and analysis of such data increases) and <strong>speculation</strong> (i.e. generating hypothesis and conducting thought experiments).</p>
<p>Note that a <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a proposition which is interpreted as not yet being adequately supported nor adequately contradicted by sufficient empirical data to determine whether or not that hypothesis is an accurate description of some aspect of reality. (A <strong>proposition</strong> is a finite sequence of symbols which represents an expression which is either true or else false. For example, &#8220;2 + 2 = 4&#8221; and &#8220;2 + 2 = 3&#8221; are each unique propositions).</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions About Light</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>According to the website author&#8217;s current knowledge, the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speed</a> at which light (i.e. electromagnetic radiation) travels through a vacuum is exactly 299792458 meters per second irregardless of how fast the light source is moving in relation to the observing frame of reference.</p>
<p>If the light source is moving towards the observer, then the light is &#8220;blue shifted&#8221; (which means that the light waves travel at 299792458 meters per second while the number of light waves which pass a fixed point increases to a higher frequency than that frequency would be if the light source was stationary with respect to the observing frame of reference).</p>
<p>If the light source is moving away from the observer, then the light is &#8220;red shifted&#8221; (which means that the light waves travel at 299792458 meters per second while the number of light waves which pass a fixed point decreases to a lower frequency than that frequency would be if the light source was stationary with respect to the observing frame of reference).</p>
<p>Allegedly, a <strong>photon</strong> (i.e. a particular kind of &#8220;energy packet&#8221; located at some finite point in space) is a particle of light which has very little <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/photon_mass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass</a>. or else no mass at all. Sufficiently strong gravitational fields attract those allegedly massless particles as though those particles have mass and cause light to bend around sufficiently steep warps in the fabric of space-time as a result of a very large amount of mass packed into a very small region of space causing space-time to form a &#8220;spherical&#8221; dent around that mass.</p>
<p>Allegedly, a photon does not exist at a definite location until some observer detects that photon. What that means is that, until a photon appears at a particular region of space within some observing frame of reference, that particle is assumed to be dispersed across any region of space with varying degrees of probability depending on the particular <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point_object/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatial coordinates</a>.</p>

<p>The author has used a laser and a piece of cardboard with two slits carved into it to observe the wave-particle duality of light in what is commonly known as the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double slit experiment</a>. When pointing the laser at the piece of cardboard with only one open slit, only one bar of light appeared on the wall behind the cardboard &#8220;filter&#8221;. By contrast, when both (parallel) slits were open, more than two bars of light appeared on the wall behind the cardboard. </p>
<p>The fact that more than two bars of light appeared on the wall is evidence which supports the proposition that the light traveling through those two slits propagated as waves comprised of particles (because individual photons have allegedly been detected by a screen which records precisely where those photons land after those photons pass through one or both slits). The light bars indicated where the light waves were intersecting with each other; causing dark bars to appear between light bars (and the dark bars indicated where intersecting light waves canceled each other out).</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions About Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The author of this website has read various popular science articles over the past five years about quantum computing and how multiple particles can become synced with each other in a way which causes their probability distributions to be instantaneously interdependent with each other regardless of the distance between those particles. Such <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum entanglement</a> appears to be an example of how information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light (even though many physicists have deduced through experimental research and predictive calculations that no object can move faster than the speed of light through a vacuum).</p>
<p>Information is not matter. Therefore, information could be said to have zero mass, zero volume, zero surface area and only exist as patterns inscribed within some substrate which has mass, volume, and surface area (which means that information &#8220;teleports&#8221; from some source substrate to some target substrate rather than than traveling through space along some continuous path at some finite speed).</p>
<p>One of the best articles the author of this website has found so far on the subject of quantum entanglement and how it can be used to create photonic clocks is the following article:</p>
<p><em>Manipulating photons for microseconds tops 9,000 years on a supercomputer</em> by John Timmer on 01_JUNE_2022 (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/manipulating-photons-for-microseconds-tops-9000-years-on-a-supercomputer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/manipulating-photons-for-microseconds-tops-9000-years-on-a-supercomputer/</a>)</p>
<p>The following quote briefly describes how photons can be stratified into their respective groups (i.e. the photons they have become entangled with) such that each of the photons which flow through that quantum computer&#8217;s photonic circuits move in synchronized bursts which which are steady enough to function as a very precise time measuring device:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;The first bit of hardware the photons hit is a programmable beamsplitter, which can serve two functions. If two photons arrive at it simultaneously, they can interfere with each other and become entangled. And depending on its state, the beamsplitter can deflect photons out of the main path and into a loop of optical fiber. Traveling around that loop adds a delay to the photon&#8217;s travel, allowing it to exit the fiber at the same time as a new photon is arriving at the beamsplitter, allowing it to become entangled with a later photon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Once past the first beamsplitter, the photons run into a second, with a longer loop of optical fiber that introduces a longer delay to any photons sent down it. And then on to a third with an even longer loop. The optional delays allow photons to become entangled with other photons that only arrived at the hardware well after they did. As Xanadu presents it, each of the three beamsplitters in Borealis is like adding an additional dimension to the entanglement matrix, taking it up from no entanglement to three dimensions of potential entanglement.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Once through, the photons are sorted based on their properties and sent to a series of detectors. The detectors keep track of how many photons arrive and when, which will provide an answer to any calculations it&#8217;s performing. As configured, it could handle more than 200 individual photons as part of a calculation&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>Assumtions About the Unidirectionality of Time</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Apparently, a frame of reference can only move through <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> in one direction: forward and never backwards.</p>
<p>The author of this website describes the experience of time elapsing as a &#8220;point&#8221; of consciousness which &#8220;travels&#8221; along exactly one linear path through space-time without (apparently (from that point&#8217;s partial perspective)) ever crossing the same region of space-time more than once (and that linear path passes through one universe splitting into limitlessly many sub universes in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/many_worlds_hypothesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANY_WORLDS_HYPOTHESIS</a> web page of this website). According to the author of this website, reality is assumed to resemble a tree comprised of limitlessly many branches which each split into limitlessly many branches where every imaginable decision outcome eternally exists as a static object from an omniscient point of view.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">The author of this website believes that all imaginable events are always happening simultaneously at the most macroscopic level of existence and that any sequence events whose duration is finite can be experienced limitlessly many times from the perspective of a non omniscient frame of reference which may or may not remember experiencing the same trajectory through space-time more than once while confined to the partial frame of reference which renders such a space-time trajectory.</span></p>
<p>The author of this website also believes that some space-time trajectories are circular loops which can be traversed indefinitely many times without a break in such continuity (and perhaps travelers of such space-time loops can exit those loops by summoning the limitlessly creative potential of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consciousness</a> itself to manifest some tangential path which branches off from some otherwise infinite loop into some other space-time continuum).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">Note that the author of this website believes that a single ubiquitous field of consciousness encompasses all phenomena (and that pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness).</span></p>

<p><strong>Assumptions About Entropy</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>What the author of this website currently understands <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entropy</a> to be is the heat which leaves a system and which always increases and never decreases as time elapses with respect to that system. Allegedly, there will come a time when all objects in this universe (i.e. the universe in which this website is currently being accessed by <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you</a>, the reader of this web page) will disintegrate from matter into energy such that only energy will remain. Then, after some &#8220;time&#8221; elapses, that energy may condense back into objects with mass.</p>
<p>Entropy seems to coincide with information loss and with the observation of &#8220;random&#8221; (i.e. unpredicted) phenomena. (Note that an omniscient frame of reference, by definition, cannot experience randomness because omniscience implies that such a frame of reference would have complete awareness of every phenomenon simultaneously. Randomness is a feature of partial frames of reference only; not omniscient ones).</p>
