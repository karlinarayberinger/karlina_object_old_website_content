<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>A <strong>phenomenon</strong> is some finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Phenomena</strong> is a set containing multiple elements such that each one of those elements is a exactly one distinct phenomenon.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is the observation of the color <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">red</strong> by human brains which are processing input signals from optic nerves detecting light whose wavelengths are approximately 700 nanometers. (Where the color red is being observed by some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial frame of reference</a> is where other colors such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#0000ff;">blue</strong> and <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">green</strong> are not simultaneously being observed by that same partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>A <strong>noumenon</strong> is a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).</p>
<p><strong>Noumena</strong> is a set containing multiple elements such that each one of those elements is a exactly one distinct noumenon.</p>
<p>If the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many worlds hypothesis</a> (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that one universe splits into multiple parallel universes when some decision is made in the parent universe) is true, then multiple partial frames of reference exist simultaneously (which means that one partial frame of reference may be rendering the color red as a phenomenon instead of rendering the color blue while some other partial frame of reference is simultaneously rendering the color blue as a phenomenon instead of rendering the color red (which means that, what one of those two partial frames of reference observes is a noumenon according to the other partial frame of reference)).</p>
<p><strong>Pure nothingness</strong> is the ubiquitous and featureless substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<p><strong>Randomness</strong> is the feature of a partial frame of reference not knowing what the outcome to a particular decision-making process (which that partial frame of reference observes) will be before that partial frame of reference observes the outcome to that decision-making process. An omniscient frame of reference does not experience randomness while that omniscient frame of reference is in its most macroscopic vantage.</p>
<p>A <strong>frame of reference</strong> is an allocation of pure nothingness into which zero phenomena, a natural number of phenomena, or infinitely many phenomena are projected.</p>
<p>A <strong>partial frame of reference</strong> does not render each phenomenon simultaneously.</p>
<p>An <strong>omniscient frame of reference</strong> simultaneously and immutably renders each phenomenon which each partial frame of reference is observing.</p>
