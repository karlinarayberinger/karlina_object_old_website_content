<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>agency</strong> as an emergent property of a sufficiently complex information processing entity which enables that entity to (a) determine what that entity&#8217;s goals are and (b) to manipulate that entity&#8217;s environment in accordance to those goals (such that the entity observes its own goals transforming from what that entity initially conceptualizes as <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noumena</a> to what that entity later observes as <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a>).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INFORMATION_PROCESSING_AGENT:</strong> a finite allocation of space, time, matter, and energy which renders perceptions, which executes decisions, and which implements behaviors as a means to attain that information processing agent&#8217;s goals.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:</strong> all phenomena which an information processing agent observes to be external to that information processing agent&#8217;s spatially finite body.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for an information processing agent to perceive and to conceptualize itself as being part of its environment such that the information processing agent makes no distinction between &#8220;outside&#8221; of that information processing agent&#8217;s mind-body and &#8220;inside&#8221; of that information processing agent&#8217;s mind-body.</p>
<p>To be succinct, an <strong>environment</strong> is a software object which an information processing agent generates which represents a particular <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> frame of reference</a> in which that information processing agent appears to itself to be at the epicenter of.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ALGORITHM:</strong> a sequence comprised of some natural number of specific non-overlapping behaviors which are each implemented one-at-a-time in a particular order within a finite space-time interval using a finite amount of energy in order to accomplish some goal.</p>
<p>An example of an algorithm is a C++ function which is used by a digital computer to calculate the Nth term of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/fibonacci_sequence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fibonacci Sequence</a> (where N is a sufficiently small nonnegative integer).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> a particular condition of an information processing agent&#8217;s environment which that information processing agent initially conceptualizes as a <strong>noumenon</strong> and which that information processing agent decides is sufficiently worthwhile for that information processing agent to invest time and energy towards attempting to manifest as a <strong>phenomenon</strong> in that information processing agent&#8217;s attention span by planning and then executing behaviors which that information processing agent thinks will be sufficiently likely to cause that goal state to become phenomenal and not merely noumenal inside of that information processing agent&#8217;s attention span.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PERCEPTION:</strong> an information processing agent rendering spatially and temporally finite phenomena inside of that agent&#8217;s attention span as a result of that information processing agent (a) receiving &#8220;low level&#8221; sensory input data through that information processing agent&#8217;s peripheral nervous system and sensory organs, (b) retrieving &#8220;middle level&#8221; sensory and conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent previously encoded and stored as memories inside of that information processing agent&#8217;s long-term information storage apparatus, and (c) generating &#8220;high level&#8221; conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent synthesizes from retrieved memories, from incoming sensory input, and from logical associations which relate one piece of data to some other piece of data in that information processing agent&#8217;s attention span.</p>
<p><em>An information processing agent’s most recent perception could be described as a function whose input is that information processing agent’s most recent behavior.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>DECISION:</strong> an information processing agent imagining a finite set of multiple options for how that information processing agent could behave and then using an <strong>algorithmic</strong> process of elimination to reduce that set of options down to exactly one option (and that selected option is what the information processing agent predicts will be the most effective option for accomplishing that information processing agent&#8217;s goals).</p>
<p><em>An information processing agent’s most recent decision could be described as a function whose input is that information processing agent’s most recent perception.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>BEHAVIOR:</strong> an information processing agent either (a) manipulating its environment within a finite interval of space-time by transferring a finite amount of energy from that information processing agent&#8217;s spatially finite body to some spatially finite object in that information processing agent&#8217;s environment or else (b) that information processing agent performing a <strong>no-op</strong> (i.e. non operation) such that the information processing agent experiences some finite interval of time passing in which that information processing agent perceives itself as not effecting any significant change to its environment.</p>
<p><em>An information processing agent’s most recent behavior could be described as a function whose input is that information processing agent’s most recent decision.</em></p>
