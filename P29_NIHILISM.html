<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">This web page attempts to define the website author&#8217;s default (i.e. &#8220;baseline&#8221;) philosophical worldview. Such a worldview may mitigate suffering to its beholder if that beholder is placed in circumstances in which the beholding information processing agent is physically prevented from pursuing its goals (perhaps because that information processing agent is incarcerated as a prisoner or hostage or if that information processing agent is crippled to the extent that its <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency</a> is severely limited).</span></p>

<p><strong>Nihilism</strong> is an ideological framework which interprets every aspect of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality</a> as having no inherent value.</p>
<p>To be precise, a <strong>value</strong> is a necessarily finite piece of information. Therefore, a single value cannot be synonymous with <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinity</a> (and if reality is contains infinitely many unique phenomena, then a single value cannot encode all of reality within some finite sequence of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a>).</p>
<p>In order for some aspect of reality to be perceived by some information processing agent as having value, that particular value must have a complementary and contrasting counterpart: whatever the information processing agent perceives as being irrelevant within the goal-oriented context of that information processing agent attempting to allocate its apparently finite cognitive resources towards effecting a desired experience (to the exclusion of all other experiences). In other words, value is what an information processing agent seeks to experience and non-value is what an information processing agent seeks to avoid wasting its time and energy towards manifesting.</p>
<p>Nihilism essentially asserts that no experience is more worthwhile than any other experience. Nihilism is a worldview which lacks preferences. Perhaps it is possible for an information processing agent to become a nihilist by perceiving itself as being fundamentally inseparable and identical to the all encompassing totality which is nature (and nature may include infinitely <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/many_worlds_hypothesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> phenomenally distinct solipsistic universes and infinitely many copies of each one of those phenomenally distinct solipsistic universes). If that is the case, then all preferences are fulfilled within the context of at least one phenomenally distinct universe.</p>
<p>The author of this website personally prefers to strive to adopt such a preference-free worldview by not being too desperate to fulfill any particular goal (while assuming that reality is fundamentally contained within one unified, immutable, and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limitlessly inclusive field of consciousness</a> (such that all desires are fulfilled somewhere within that multiverse)).</p>
