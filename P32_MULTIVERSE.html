<p><strong>MULTIVERSE</strong></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs describe <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> as being a static “block” which contains all imaginable decision-making trajectories.</span></p>

<p>The following sentence is a hypothesis (and a <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a claim about some aspect of reality which is derived from incomplete knowledge about that aspect of reality).</p>
<p><em>Every phenomenal object which can be imagined already exists unconditionally and eternally without an instantiation point nor a deletion point from the vantage of reality as an all-encompassing whole (and reality as an all-encompassing whole is aware of every component of itself simultaneously).</em></p>
<p>If the previous sentence is true, then each noumenal object is unconditionally experienced as a phenomenal object by reality as an all-encompassing whole (which means that reality as an all-encompassing whole experiences indefinitely many phenomenally distinct partial frames of reference simultaneously).</p>
<p>Such a concurrence of multiple partial frames of reference (and that multiple includes each imaginable phenomenal object) is defined as the one and only possible <strong>multiverse</strong> throughout all existence (and that multiverse is synonymous with reality as an all-encompassing whole (and reality as an all-encompassing whole is synonymous with <strong>nature</strong>)).</p>
<p>A <strong>partial frame of reference</strong> is defined as a field of awareness which renders exactly one <strong>universe</strong> (and that universe is subset of the entire multiverse (and that universe is always smaller than the multiverse)).</p>
<p>According to the partial frame of reference which is rendering a particular universe, that universe appears to be a linear and unidirectional space-time continuum (and that <strong>space-time continuum</strong> is a succession of some natural number of or else infinitely many timeless snapshots of apparently one finite allocation of space).</p>
<p>An <strong>omniscient frame of reference</strong> is defined as a field of awareness which renders each imaginable universe simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to the omniscient frame of reference which is rendering the one and only multiverse, each universe inside of that multiverse splits into indefinitely many phenomenally distinct universes each time a decision is made inside of a parent universe.</p>
<p><strong>Static</strong> is defined as the perceived absence of change within some partition of nature (and that partition of nature may be the whole of nature itself or else some subset of nature which is smaller than the whole of nature).</p>
<p><strong>Change</strong> is defined as noticing a particular phenomenon emerging out of pure nothingness or else disappearing back into pure nothingness.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>panpsychic hypothesis</strong> (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that reality as an all-encompassing whole is contained within exactly one mind), reality as an all-encompassing whole takes place inside of exactly one ubiquitous (and therefore boundless) frame of reference. That ubiquitous frame of reference is fundamentally composed of <strong>pure nothingness</strong> (and pure nothingness is simultaneous with <strong>pure consciousness</strong>).</p>
<p>It may be inferred that change, and therefore the passage of time, is perceptible from a partial frame of reference but not from an omniscient frame of reference.</p>
