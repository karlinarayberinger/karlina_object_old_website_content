<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The statements on this web page describe how time may be objective and how time may be subjective. If time is <strong>objective</strong> rather than subjective, then one second has the same temporal length throughout all frames of reference. If time is <strong>subjective</strong> rather than objective, then one second may or may not be the same temporal length as some other second.</span></p>

<pre>X: "0...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8". // There are 24 dots enclosed in the string.

Y: "1.........2...3...4...........5...6..7..8......9." // There are 39 dots enclosed in the string.
</pre>
<p><strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> are each unique and partial <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frames of reference</a>.</p>
<p>X and Y are each watching a <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clock</a> tick for nine seconds. <span style="background:#00ffff;">(The clock which X is watching may or may not be the same clock which Y is watching).</span></p>
<p>From X&#8217;s perspective, the gap between each second which elapses on the clock display is exactly the same temporal length.</p>
<p>(A second-long interval is experienced by X when the number of seconds displayed on some clock is observed by X to change from one pattern named <strong>time_i</strong> to some other pattern named <strong>time_i_+_1</strong> such the pattern which time_i represents is observed by X to be phenomenally distinct from the pattern which time_i_+_1 represents).</p>
<p>From Y&#8217;s perspective, the gap between each second which elapses on the clock display varies in temporal length. In other words, according to Y, some seconds seem to occur for longer periods of time than do other seconds.</p>
<p>(A second-long interval is experienced by Y when the number of seconds displayed on some clock is observed by Y to change from one pattern named <strong>time_k</strong> to some other pattern named <strong>time_k_+_1</strong> such the pattern which time_k represents is observed by Y to be phenomenally distinct from the pattern which time_k_+_1 represents).</p>
<p>It could be argued that, according to Y, a second is not interpreted as a standard unit of temporal length (because time appears to speed up and slow down as Y watches a clock and notices that some seconds appear to be stretched out into longer temporal lengths while other seconds appear to be compressed into shorter temporal lengths).</p>
<p>It could also be argued that, according to Y, the clock display is broken. In other words, according to Y, the clock is delayed at some points in time or else it is sped up at some points in time such that the number of seconds elapsed is inaccurate.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">If the clock which Y observes is broken, then &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; (i.e. a sequence of 3 dots) more objectively represents a second-long interval of time than does the mere appearance of two consecutive numbers which each represent some number of seconds elapsed. If that is the case, then Y objectively observed that 13 seconds elapsed while the clock displayed that 9 seconds elapsed. (Y would observe that 13 seconds elapsed because the timer interval length Y observes is represented by a string containing 39 dots near the top of this web page). Furthermore, if the clock which Y observes is broken, then the clock which Y observes is not the same clock which X observes. (The clock which X observes is represented by a string containing 24 dots near the top of this web page).</span></p>
