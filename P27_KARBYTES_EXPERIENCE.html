<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following statements describe the intention to eternally preserve the intellectual property which comprises <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a> (i.e. the website whose domain name is phonetically worded as <strong>Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</strong>). If the author of this website and this website are both able to survive for a long enough period of time, then this website will likely become an extension of the author&#8217;s nervous system and the author&#8217;s nervous system will likely become an extension of this website such that those two entities will continuously update each other in a cyclical feedback loop and generate symbiotic intelligence which evolves to become increasingly complex as the time elapses along the space-time continuum which KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE represents.</span></p>

<p><strong>KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE</strong> is a subset of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> whose phenomenal content consists exclusively of the first-person experience which the author of this website (i.e. an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> named <strong>Karlina Ray Beringer</strong>) renders while instantiating, updating, and preserving this website (ideally in a format which is unconditionally accessible to the public as a piece of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public domain</a> intellectual property).</p>
<p>The author of this website intends for the instantiation of the &#8220;software object&#8221; referred to by the term KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE to continue existing for an infinitely long period of time (and the author of this website understands that KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE may possibly be instantiated for only a finite period of time).</p>
<p>If KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE is able to be instantiated for an infinitely long period of time, then KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE would be the infinitely long evolutionary period of the author&#8217;s own first-person experience and the infinitely long evolutionary period of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual property</a> which comprises this website.</p>
<p>Note that it is hypothetically possible for any first-person experience to transition from being a rendered inside of a <strong>partial</strong> <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame of reference</a> to being rendered (at least temporarily) inside of an <strong>omniscient</strong> frame of reference.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">If a first-person experience named X transitions from being partial to becoming omniscient for any length of time and is named Y while omniscient, then X exists as a subset of Y&#8217;s knowledge while Y&#8217;s knowledge lasts.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">Whether or not X becomes omniscient and whether or not X is immortal, any omniscient frame of reference would render X as a piece of that omniscient frame of reference&#8217;s knowledge for as long as that omniscient frame of reference exists.</span></p>
<p>If a mind other than the author of this website is interpreting the words displayed on this <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/karbytes_experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web page</a> as verbalized thoughts which the author of this website essentially intends for such words to convey, then the information encoded by the author of this into the words displayed on this web page is sufficiently retrievable to at least one first-person experience other than the author of this website (and such information occurs both inside of and outside of the scope named KARBYTES_EXPERIENCE).</p>
