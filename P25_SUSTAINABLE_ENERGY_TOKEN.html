<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following outline defines the main variables of a prospective economic system whose constituent monetary units are digital assets which are each minted weekly from sustainable energy production infrastructure, distributed in equal number to each citizen every week as a universal basic income, and set to expire within a few years in order to prevent &#8220;economic inflation&#8221; and to prevent financial transaction records from getting too voluminous in databases with finite storage capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the term <strong>&#8220;economic inflation&#8221;</strong> is used to imply a decrease in the value of a single unit of monetary currency as time elapses and as the total number of such units of currency within an economy increases (while the physical availability of products and services which money is used to purchase remains relatively stagnant or even decreases).</span> For example, a single <strong>SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_TOKEN</strong> instance (i.e. a single Sustainable Energy Token) could be used to purchase no more than $20 (and no less than $1 ) worth of valued products and services at time_0 while a single Sustainable Energy Token at time_1 could be used to purchase no more than $10 (and no less than $1) worth of valued products and services if Sustainable Energy Tokens were not set to expire (and given that time_0 precedes time_1 along a space-time trajectory which represents the evolution of some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/technocracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>N</strong> is a nonnegative integer which represents the total number of Sustainable Energy Token bank accounts which are in a human civilization during a particular week.</span></p>
<p>Note that each human individual has exactly one Sustainable Energy Token bank account for the duration of that human individual&#8217;s lifespan. When a human individual is born, a new Sustainable Energy Token bank account is instantiated and assigned to that particular human individual. When a human individual dies, the Sustainable Energy Token bank account which is associated with that particular human individual is deleted and any Sustainable Energy Tokens which remain in that bank account prior to that bank account&#8217;s deletion are also deleted.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>T</strong> is a nonnegative integer which represents some constant natural number of watts of electricity which are produced exclusively via sustainable means (and T represents an amount of electricity which is sufficient to instantiate exactly one new Sustainable Energy Token).</span></p>
<p>Note that <strong>sustainable energy production</strong> is the process of converting naturally-occurring inputs into usable electricity in a manner which produces almost zero pollution and in a manner which can be replicated for indefinitely long periods of time. <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photovoltaics</a> is an especially versatile means for sustainably producing energy.</p>
<p>A photovoltaic cell is a &#8220;solid state&#8221; device (i.e. has no moving parts) which passively converts incoming photons from starlight into outgoing electrons by absorbing those photons into some kind of material which releases electrons when the  electrons inside of that material become too energetic to stay in orbit around their respective atoms. Those freed electrons then flow out of the photovoltaic cell across wires as usable electricity.</p>
<p>Note that electrical energy can be stored as potential energy inside of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flywheel</a> cables which are each wound up around a spool using incoming energy which causes that spool to rotate and store than incoming energy as potential energy in similar fashion to the way a coiled <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring</a> stores potential energy while that spring is compressed until that spring is released and allowed to expand and then resume a relatively stable and relatively potential-energy-free state (which is neither compressed nor elongated). When the energy stored in those wound up flywheels is needed by the encompassing human civilization, the flywheels are allowed to unwind and cause turbines to rotate <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnets</a> such that an electrical current is generated and electrons subsequently flow out of the system across wires as usable electricity.</p>

<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>E</strong> is a nonnegative integer which represents the total number of watts of electricity which are produced by a human civilization&#8217;s sustainable energy generation infrastructure during a particular 168 hour (i.e. one week) cycle.</span></p>
<p>To be precise, each new Sustainable Energy Token costs exactly T watts of electricity to instantiate. Therefore, the total number of Sustainable Energy Tokens produced during a particular week is assumed to be equal to that week&#8217;s E value divided by T (and that quotient is rounded down to the nearest integer).</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>S</strong> is a nonnegative integer which represents the total number of Sustainable Energy Tokens which were generated during a particular 168 hour (i.e. one week) cycle.</span></p>
<p>S is the rounded down nonnegative integer result of dividing E by T.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>W</strong> is a nonnegative integer which represents the number of newly-minted Sustainable Energy Tokens to distribute to each one of the N Sustainable Energy Tokens bank accounts at the end of a particular 168 hour (i.e. one week) cycle.</span></p>
<p>W is a nonnegative integer which represents the rounded down nonnegative integer result of dividing S by N.</p>
<p>To be precise, each Sustainable Energy Tokens bank account owner gets the same amount of Sustainable Energy Tokens deposited into its bank account as does every other Sustainable Energy Tokens bank account owner in that system during that week as a universal basic income.</p>
<p>Note that the W amount may vary from one week to the next due to the fact that the E and N values may fluctuate. T is the only variable defined in this web page which does not fluctuate.</p>
<p>Each week on Sunday between 11:50PM and 11:59PM, exactly W Sustainable Energy Tokens are deposited into each one of the N Sustainable Energy Token bank accounts.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><strong>P</strong> is a natural number which represents the lifespan of each Sustainable Energy Token in terms of hours. The minimum P value is 8760 hours (i.e. one year) and the maximum P value is 43800 hours (i.e. five years).</span></p>
<p>Note that each of the Sustainable Energy Tokens which are minted during a particular week are assigned the same P value (i.e. expiration date).</p>
<p>Note that the following information about each Sustainable Energy Token is available in a public database for no more than ten years after that particular Sustainable Energy Token was minted: sustainable energy production factory of origination, date of instantiation, planned expiration date, hours of life remaining, T value, and each financial transaction in which that particular Sustainable Energy Token was exchanged (and those financial transactions are listed in chronological order).</p>
<p>Note that each <strong>financial transaction record</strong> includes the time at which the associated financial transaction was completed, the unique identifier associated with the sender bank account, the unique identifier associated with the recipient bank account, the total number of Sustainable Energy Tokens involved in that transaction, and the attributes specified in the previous paragraph about the particular  Sustainable Energy Token which is associated with that financial transaction record.</p>
<p>Note that, because updating the financial records database takes some degree of energy to implement, a relatively small amount of Sustainable Energy Tokens are included in the cost of each financial transaction as a processing fee. Either the sender, the receiver, or both the sender and the receiver pay for that processing fee.</p>
